Enter a radius: 
Radius = 2.500
Circle's area = 19.635
Quadrant's area = 4.909
Square's area = 6.250
Ratio of quadrant's area to square's area = 0.785
Calculated Pi using the quadrant's area and the square's area = 3.1415926536

Number of points in circle = 3141611971
Number of points in square = 4000000000
Ratio of points in circle to points in square = 0.785
Calculated Pi using points in circle and points in square = 3.1416119710
