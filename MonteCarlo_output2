Enter a radius: 
Radius = 5.000
Circle's area = 78.540
Quadrant's area = 19.635
Square's area = 25.000
Ratio of quadrant's area to square's area = 0.785
Calculated Pi using the quadrant's area and the square's area = 3.1415926536

Number of points in circle = 3141616053
Number of points in square = 4000000000
Ratio of points in circle to points in square = 0.785
Calculated Pi using points in circle and points in square = 3.1416160530
